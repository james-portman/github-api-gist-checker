This is a small python app which uses the Github API to check when a user has created a new Gist.

To use it, either install python requests or use the following steps to create a python virtualenv:

$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ python checkgists.py
